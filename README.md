# Natural or artificial?

This repository trains the model which is used in
the [Natural or artificial?](https://www.shawnchahal.com/natural-or-artificial) web app.

## What does the app do?

[Natural or artificial?](https://www.shawnchahal.com/natural-or-artificial) is a web app where the user uploads a photo
and finds out if it depicts a natural or an artificial environment. The app employs a convolutional neural network which
was trained on approximately 1700 images manually downloaded from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) depicting a natural
or an artificial environment. The model was trained using [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) in
Python.
